## Description
We were tasked with making a work day schedule that saves the data into the local storage. I started by createing the hour block containers and making them able to write text into. I then created a button event that is placed at the end of the text boxes. That button event is what saves the text written in that box to the local storage. I also added a live date and time function that has a ticking clock. The past, present, and future classes will be linked to the live clock so that the pas boxes will be gray, the present box will be red, and the future boxes will be green. Once all that is compete you will have a work day scheduler that saves your data to the local storage and displays a live date and time.
